## Implementation Notes

- The Azure Blob Storage upload feature is now fully implemented and integrated from the UI to the backend.
- Upload actions in the UI for both Android and iOS builds now trigger the backend upload logic, with progress and error handling.
- The backend logic is robust, with comprehensive unit tests covering all edge cases and error scenarios.
- The test suite is in sync with the code, ensuring future changes are caught by CI.
- **Health monitoring system provides real-time visibility into service health.**
- **Platform management enables efficient Android/iOS build operations.**
- **Configuration persistence ensures settings are maintained across sessions.**
