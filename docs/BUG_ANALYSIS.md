# Bug Analysis

This document summarizes potential issues found in the codebase based on a search for common error/exception/bug keywords.

## Potential Issues

1. **UI-to-Controller Communication**
   - In `MainController`, the code attempts to connect to `self.view.refresh_builds` as a signal, but it is a method. This will cause an `AttributeError` and should be refactored to use a proper Qt signal.

2. **Azure Integration**
   - In `azure_webapp.py`, there are multiple error handling blocks for Azure operations (e.g., "Failed to initialize Azure clients", "Failed to get web apps"). These errors are logged but may not be properly propagated to the UI, leading to silent failures.

3. **Log Streaming**
   - In `LogController`, the `log_message` signal was missing, causing an `AttributeError` when the UI tries to connect to it. This has been fixed, but similar issues might exist in other controllers.

4. **Error Handling in UI**
   - In `build_view.py` and `database_view.py`, error messages are shown using `QMessageBox.critical`, but there is no centralized error handling strategy. This could lead to inconsistent error reporting.

5. **Resource Cleanup**
   - In `main_window.py`, there are multiple `except Exception` blocks for cleanup operations (e.g., "Error cleaning up UI resources", "Error cleaning up log viewer"). These might mask specific issues and should be reviewed for proper error handling.

6. **Configuration Issues**
   - The `config/webapps.json` file is used for Azure Web App selection, but if it is missing or malformed, the application might crash. Consider adding validation or fallback mechanisms.

7. **Testing**
   - In `tests/integration/test_main.py`, there are assertions for error handling, but they might not cover all edge cases. Review the test coverage for error scenarios.

## Recommendations

- Refactor UI-to-controller communication to use Qt signals consistently.
- Centralize error handling and logging for Azure operations.
- Review and improve error propagation from models to UI.
- Add validation for configuration files and provide fallback mechanisms.
- Enhance test coverage for error scenarios.
